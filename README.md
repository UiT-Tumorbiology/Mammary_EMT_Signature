# Mammary_EMT_Signature
This repository includes the scripts used for developing a Mammary EMT signature
Here, we have analyzed RNA-sequencing data from three different mammary epithelial cell line-derived EMT models and identified a robust mammary EMT gene expression signature that separates breast cancers into distinct subgroups. Most of the analysis is done using R, although initial analysis was also performed using CLC Genomics Workbench 22 that incorporates edgeR to perform differential expression analysis.
